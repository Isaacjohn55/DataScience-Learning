# Renew Power Hiring Hackathon

ReNew Power shared minute-wise normalised data of wind speed, power and temperature data for multiple components of a wind turbine. The company is looking to create a model to get an ideally functioning turbineâ€™s expected rotor bearing temperature. It will then use the model to check the deviation of the actual rotor bearing temperature of the faulty turbine from the expected temperature. 

Evaluation :
